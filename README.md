## System Description
Give a brief overview of your proposed system and the business or concept it supports.
Examples:<br>
* Example 1: “We would like to develop an application that will allow GG Garage Door Repair to generate invoices for customers at the site of a repair. The application would also accept credit or debit card payment”.
* Example 2: “We would like to start a business that allows people to exchange skills such as furniture assembly, painting, etc. The application we develop would enable people to post the skills they had to offer and the skills they would accept in exchange.”
* Example 3: "We are developing a prototype that will allow a cell phone to communicate with a drone."
## Description of Prototype to be delivered in BTS530
In BTS530 you will create a prototype of part of your system in four iterations. In this section describe the prototype you plan to deliver. Examples:
* Example 1: We plan to deliver a prototype system that provides authentication for both admin and technician and allows the admin to enter garage door parts information and the technician to select from the parts information to create a work order. The work order will be used to create an invoice in the final system (BTS630).
* Example 2: We plan to deliver a prototype system that has the following functionality: add global skills; register with skills to exchange (simple version of the final function--just name and skills); and search for skills. We will try to implement the real (final) interface so that we can just add functionality to it in BTS630.
* Example 3: In our BTS530 protoype we are going to try to get an Android phone to query a DJI X2 drone, specifically to get the drone to recognize a set of messages: on, off, flash left, flash right. give me your position. 

#### In the Iteration Tasks sections that follow you will have two lists of tasks: Your To do list, and your Completed list. Each iteration you will add the tasks that you plan to do in that iteration. If you complete the tasks in that iteration you move them to the completed tasks for that iteration. Examples of the types of tasks that you might find in your task lists are given at the end of this readme file.
