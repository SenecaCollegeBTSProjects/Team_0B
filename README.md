## System Description
We would like to develop an application that will allow GG Garage Door Repair to generate invoices for customers at the site of a repair. The application would also accept credit or debit card payment.

## Description of Prototype to be delivered in BTS530
We plan to deliver a prototype system that provides authentication for both admin and technician and allows the admin to enter garage door parts information and the technician to select from the parts information to create a work order. The work order will be used to create an invoice in the final system (BTS630).
